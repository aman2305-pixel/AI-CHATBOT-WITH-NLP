The third task involved building a basic AI chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with libraries such as NLTK or spaCy. I utilized NLTK to tokenize and process user input and implemented a simple rule-based chatbot capable of answering predefined queries. Additional enhancements included the use of wordnet for synonym recognition and pattern matching to handle variations in input. This task introduced me to the core concepts of NLP, such as tokenization, stemming, and intent recognition. Developing this chatbot in VS Code allowed me to test the bot in real-time through the terminal and manage dependencies using the integrated environment.
